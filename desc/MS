Description: TSO command displays various system statistics and execution information.
 The MS (Master Summary) TSO command displays various MVS System
 Information through the use of subcommands (System Statistics, Link
 Pack Information, TSO statistics, System Initiators, and information on
 executing Jobs, Started Tasks and TSO users).
 
 The source for this was the SHARE MVS GROUP Modification tape, version
 80-007 from July 28, 1980; specifically from the embedded Los Angeles
 MVS Users Group tapes contained at files #48 through #55.  I see that
 the version of this tape available from CBT at this time no longer
 contains these files, so I am glad that I have an earlier version of
 the tape available.  The load module for the command is built from
 three CSECTs (MS, JOBS, and USERS) contained on file #53; the help
 member is found in file #49, and a required macro is from file #51.
