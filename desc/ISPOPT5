Description: ISPF Option 5 - Batch language processor
 Option 5 selections use a CLIST and Panel for each language processor 
 request to create instream JCL and submit for batch processing very 
 similar to real-iron ISPF Option 5. CLISTs were selected due to ease of
 maintenance and realizing results immediately! The ISPF Skeleton 
 function in not currently supported in the current version of ISPF from
 Wally Mclaughlin.

 The batch functionality presented here does NOT duplicate original IPSF 
 functionality, this is intentional.
