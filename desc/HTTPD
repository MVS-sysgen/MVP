Description: HTTP Server for MVS
 The HTTPD software is a HTTP protocol 1.0 server designed for the MVS
 (release 38J) operating system running on a Hercules emulator. This 
 allows for both static and dynamic documents to be served from this 
 legacy operating system. Think of it as modern day internet (web browser)
 meets MVS from yester year.
