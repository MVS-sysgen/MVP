Description: IMON is a real-time system monitor for MVS 3.8j

 The Interactive Monitoring Program (IMP) is a full-screen
 real-time monitor of the MVS Operating System that runs in the
 TSO foreground environment and interacts with the TSO user via
 a 3270-family or compatible terminal.  IMP is designed to
 exploit terminal features and so is best viewed on a terminal
 with extended colour and highlighting capability.  Program
 Access and Program Function Keys are used to simplify input
 requests while intensity, colour and highlighting are used to
 assist the understanding of output.
