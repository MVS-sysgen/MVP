Description: TSO command to display DASD VTOC information 
 The VTOC TSO command displays information from the Volume Table of
 Contents of selected DASD.  It allows an incredible permutation of
 various selection criteria, yielding a very powerful command for your
 toolbox.
 
 It is located in File #112 of the older version #129 CBT tape.  It was
 written by R. L. Miller of Fireman's Fund Insurance in San Rafael, CA.
 There is a later version of VTOC on the more current versions of CBT,
 but they require modification in order to install/use on MVS 3.8j, and
 this version is quite acceptable on our older version of MVS.
