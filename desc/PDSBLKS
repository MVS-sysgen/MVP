Description: TSO command to display directory blocks allocated/used for a Partitioned Dataset 
 PDSBLKS is a TSO command that displays the number of directory blocks
 allocated and used for a specified Partitioned Dataset.
 
 I retrieved it from the Goddard AWS tape image at the CBT tape site.
 It was originally designed and developed by J. Schindler at the NASA,
 Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbeld, MD.  There is no date of
 origin in the source code and no updates listed, but the source and
 help were offloaded from a 2314 and the entire Goddard tape contents
 seem to be relevant to OS/360 MVT, so it seems safe to say this code
 has been around for a while.  But it still works as designed under MVS
 3.8j.
