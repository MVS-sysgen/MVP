Description: TSO command displays dataset allocation and freespace information
 The LISTSPC TSO command displays allocation information for specified
 datasets or free space for selected DASD volumes.  Although the DD TSO
 command displays more useful information for datasets, I had this
 pulled from the CBT tape so I thought I would include it here.
 
 The source for LISTSPC is located in File #49 of the older version #129
 CBT tape.  It also requires a separate external module - LOCINDEX -
 which is located in File #50.  The help text is located in File #51,
 combined with the help for another command.
