Description: MVS Auto-Pilot Runscript module
 This program will read input data from a member of a PDS with      
 DDNAME SCRIPTS.  If no SCRIPTS DDNAME is found, SYS1.PARMLIB       
 will be used. Sample scripts are available in SYS2.SAMPLIB.
                                                                    
 The member to be used is specified via the PARM passed to the      
 program.  If none if specified, a default of BSPRUNSC is used      
                                                                    
 Syntax of script files:                                            
 Leading spaces will be removed from the script line
