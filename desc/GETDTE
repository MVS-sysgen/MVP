Description: Get Date-Time-Env Utility
 GETDTE is a utility used to obtain current date-time and
 environment information.  This subroutine requires a work area
 passed from the calling program.

 Results are returned to the caller via the provided commarea
 and/or CLIST variable, RDTEANSR.

 Based on how GETDTE is called, results are returned as listed
 below:

 1) If GETDTE is called from higher-level lanaguage (i.e. COBOL)
    with a commarea, results are returned in the commarea.
 2) If GETDTE is called from assembler (i.e. IFOX00) with a
    commarea, results are returned in the commarea.
 3) If GETDTE is called from TSO (foreground or background)
    with a commarea, results are returned in commarea and CLIST
    variable, RDTEANSR.
    Note:  If IKJCT441 is not located, no CLIST variable is
           created and return code set to 8.  Commarea contains
           valid data.
 4) If GETDTE is called from TSO (foreground or background)
    with NO commarea, results are returned ONLY in CLIST
    variable, RDTEANSR.
    Note:  If IKJCT441 is not located, no CLIST variable is
           created and return code set to 8.  No data is
           returned in the commarea.
 5) If GETDTE is called from BATCH (EXEC PGM=GETDTE),
    job step will most likely abend with S0C4!
    -- NOTE: INVALID use scenerio
 6) If GETDTE is called from BATCH (EXEC PGM=GETDTE,PARM='xyz..'),
    job step will most likely abend with S0C4!
    -- NOTE: INVALID use scenerio
