Description: Allows console Program Function Keys to be set at IPL time 
 The functions assigned to the console(s) Program Function Keys persist
 from IPL to IPL, but there is no convenient way for those settings to
 be assigned under MVS 3.8j.  Under later MVS-OS/390-zOS versions there
 is a SYS1.PARMLIB member that may be used for that function.
 Fortunately, this utility was written in the era of MVS 3.8j (actually
 prior to OS/VS2) to solve this requirement and is available for our
 use.
 
 It is located in File #295 of the older CBT tape version #249 and was
 written by Barry Goldberg at the Auto Club of Southern California.
