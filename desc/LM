Description: TSO command displays directory for Partitioned Datasets
 The LM TSO command displays the directory (member list) from a
 Partitioned Dataset.  A mask may be specified to select members to list
 based upon their name.  The command may also be used to create a
 sequential dataset containing the name list for use by another program
 or command.
 
 The source for LM is located in File #300 of the older version #249 CBT
 tape.  It was written by Dick Szeide and this version has modifications
 by Rick Duvall and J. Schindler.
