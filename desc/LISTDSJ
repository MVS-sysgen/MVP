Description: Dataset Information for MVS3.8J / Hercules
 LISTDSJ, accepts a data set name and provides
 dataset information from various VTOC DSCBs including directory
 information for PDS files via CLIST variables.  A full list of
 CLIST (symbolic) variables is provided below in Table 3.

 LISTDSJ is similar to LISTDSI introduced and enhanced after
 MVS3.8J.  Some of the symbolic names used by LISTDSJ may not
 use the same values of a current LISTDSI version or may not be
 defined as in the current version of LISTDSI.

 All CLIST variables are initialized to question marks (?)
 and accordingly set to dataset attribute values as processed by
 LISTDSJ.
