Description: This program analyzes the TSO broadcast dataset
  It displays the number of available blocks and how they
  are used.  It also displays the TSO users who have
  messages waiting.  In addition it also does a validity
  check on records which are in the message pool to assure
  they are chained off of a user record.  According to
  documentation, instances occur which can result in these
  garbage records existing.


SAMPLE EXECUTION JCL can be found in SYS2.SAMPLIB(BRODSCAN)
