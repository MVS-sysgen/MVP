Description: TSO command displays the attributes of datasets
 DD is a TSO command that displays the attributes of datasets.  It does
 not require the dataset for which information is to be displayed be
 catalogued, and it provides more information for Non-VSAM datasets (and
 Generation Data Groups) than LISTCAT does.
 
 It is located in File #163 of the CBT tape and is part of a collection
 of batch programs and TSO commands contributed by Dave Phillips of
 Ouiedo, FL.
