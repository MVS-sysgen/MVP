Description: List all availble space on DASD that are online 
 
 IBHLSPAC produces a list of free DASD space by using the SMF LSPACE
 routine (SVC 78).  Information is provided for all online DASD volumes
 by scanning the UCB and additional information is included by matching
 the online volumes with the comment information contained in the
 VATLST00 member of SYS1.PARMLIB.
 
 It is located in File #21 of the CBT tape and originated from G M
 Schlesak at Bell & Howell, Evanston, IL.
 
 A sample of the output can be seen in [1]IBHLSPAC Output.
