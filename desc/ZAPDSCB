Description: Batch program to change DSCB attributes of any DASD dataset 
 ZAPDSCB is a batch program that can be used to change the attributes of
 any existing DASD dataset.  Elements that may be changed with the
 program are:
 * DCB characteristics
 * protection status
 * expiration date
 * use count
 * secondary space allocation amount
 
 It is located in File #163 of the CBT tape and is part of a collection
 of batch programs and TSO commands contributed by Dave Phillips of
 Ouiedo, FL.  He includes this caution in the comments of the program's
 source:
 
 "... care must be taken using this program - it is about as
 dangerous as SUPERZAP."
