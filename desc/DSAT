Description: TSO command displays data set information by index level.
 DSAT is a TSO command that displays information about one or several
 datasets which are selected based upon operands specified with the
 command.
 
 It is located in file #860 of version 488 of the CBT tape.  This file
 contains a collection of programs written, or modified, by Gerhard
 Postpischil.  The program was originally submitted to the CBT by
 Florida Power and Light and the version Gerhard has included was from
 the older version 249 of CBT.  I went back to the original submission
 to retrieve the help information and updated it to match Gerhard's
 version of the program.
