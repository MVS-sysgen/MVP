Description: Builds JCL to re link edit load module(s)
 ZZRELINK is a utility that can be used to examine selected load modules
 from a PDS (or an entire PDS) and either generate JCL to execute the
 link editor to re-link the modules or dynamically invoke the link
 editor to re-link them modules.
 
 ZZRELINK is located in File #361 of the CBT tape and was written by
 Frank Johnston of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.  The assembled load
 modules for the utilities on File #361 are contained in file #362, but
 since most of the contents of the CBT tape were assembled on much later
 operating systems than we are using under Hercules, I prefer to take
 the source and re-assemble it.
