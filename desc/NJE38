Description: NJE Subsystem for MVS 3.8

 NJE38 provides a mechanism to bring NJE data transmission into MVS 3.8. NJE38
 can connect to other NJE capable hosts whether they are MVS-, VM-, or 
 DOS-based, and receive file data from these systems and send file data to 
 them.

 NJE38 provides connectivity to other systems via binary-synchronous 
 communication (BSC) lines. These  lines are emulated in a Hercules environment
 by the use of the TCPNJE device driver in Hercules. The system on the other 
 end of the connection also uses emulated BSC lines, or for certain operating
 systems  that appeared after MVS 3.8, a choice of emulated BSC lines or NJE 
 over TCP/IP in order to connect back to NJE38.

 NJE38 does not provide a JES-based NJE environment like that of later MVS
 releases. The NJE capability  provided by NJE38 is similar to JES-based NJE,
 but remains a subset of later capabilities. There are a variety of reasons for
 only having a subset of the possible capabilities and a major one is that 
 system security mechanisms employed by MVS 3.8 do not provide the necessary 
 features to fully implement certain NJE capabilities. Nevertheless, NJE38 
 provides significant capability and will serve to get data files into and out
 of MVS 3.8 over an NJE network, including job streams, listings, sequential
 and partitioned datasets, and more.
 
 Note: After installation you must re-IPL your environment with CLPA
