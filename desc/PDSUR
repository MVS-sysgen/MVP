Description: Unload/Reload PDS in IEHMOVE format 
 
 In February 2018 Sam Golub notified me that the PDSUR utility,
 originally written by Gene Czarcinski in 1973, has been added to the
 CBT collection.  I am making the installation jobstream and
 documentation available here, as well as adding the utility to my
 SYSCPK tools volume, as I think it is a great alternative when you find
 yourself needing to reload datasets that were offloaded using the IBM
 utility IEHMOVE.  It may also be used to create tapes containing
 offloaded datasets that is compatible with IEHMOVE.
 
 PDSUR is presently located in the Updates section of the CBT website,
 but will likely appear on the next version of the CBT tape when it is
 cut.  It will reside in in File #949.
