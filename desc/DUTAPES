Description: TSO command display TAPE unit information on TSO User's screen (also STC)
 DUTAPES is a TSO command that displays information about all Tape
 devices defined in the IPLed system.  It may also be executed as a
 started task from the MVS operator's console.
 
 It is located in File #301 of the CBT overflow tape (was formerly
 located in file #352 of the main CBT tape) and is part of a collection
 of batch programs and TSO commands contributed by Ken True at INTEL,
 although from the comments at the top of this module, the original
 version may have been derived from a program created a United Air
 Lines.
