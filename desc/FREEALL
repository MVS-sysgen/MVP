Description: TSO command frees all allocated datasets
 FREEALL is a TSO command that has been around for a long time, and
 there are many different versions out there.  It was on my "want to
 install" list when I started digging around in the old 249 version of
 the CBT tape, so when I saw a couple of different versions there, I
 pulled them off to examine.  The notes on each version said that they
 occasionally experienced unresolved ABENDs,  Not what I wanted to have
 first-hand experience with, nor did I particularly want to search for
 the problem and resolve it.  So, I looked at the current version of the
 CBT tape and found several versions there, as well.
 
 I chose the one located in File #300, which is part of a collection of
 TSO commands contributed by Jim Marshall, formerly of the U.S. Air
 Force and now with U.S. Treasury Department.  You will find some of his
 batch utilities in my CBT ware collection, also.  He does wonderful
 work!  I was delighted to find that his FREEALL assembles and functions
 perfectly under MVS 3.8j.
