Description: TSO command to copy statements embedded in CLIST to a dataset 
 INSTREAM is a TSO command that provides a means to pass embeded
 statements in a Command List to an invoked program.
 
 I retrieved it from File #300 of the #437 version of the CBT tape and
 is part of a collection of TSO commands from Jim Marshall of the Air
 Force.  It was originally written by Bill Godfrey at the Planning
 Research Corporation in July of 1976.
