Description: Load IEHMOVE modules & link to IEHMOVE

   MOVELOAD - Load IEHMOVE modules & link to IEHMOVE
   MOVELOD - Load/Delete IEHMOVE modules

     Entry:  As at entry to IEHMOVE

     Exit:   As at exit from IEHMOVE

 When using IEHMOVE on small data sets, IEHMOVE can do as much
 I/O loading its modules as copying data.  This program
 pre-loads all RENT or REUS IEHMOVE modules to avoid the
 program load I/O.

 Since the normal IEHMOVE requires APF authorization to run,
 this module would have to be linked AC=1 to run it.
