Description: TSO command searchs members of PDS for string (similar to 'check' function of PDSUPDTE)
 FIND is a TSO command that scans all members of a Partitioned Dataset
 for an argument string and reports the number of occurrences found.
 
 I retrieved it from File #166 of the #341 version of the CBT tape and
 is part of a collection submitted by Vinh Vu of Frito Lay.
