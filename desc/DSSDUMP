Description: DATA SET DUMP IN ADRDSSU FORM
 DSSDUMP - QUICK AND DIRTY SUBSTITUTE FOR MVS 3.8J USERS         

 To run authorized requires READ access to the profile DSSAUTH in the
 FACILITY class.
                                                            
 PROGRAM IS AUTHORIZED, AND REENTRANT (but not all subroutines)  
 REQUIRED DD CARDS:                                              
  SYSPRINT - PROCESSING LOG                                     
  SYSIN    - REQUESTS:                                          
        Note that all reserved words may be abbreviated to the 
        first three characters (e.g., OPT for OPTIONS)         
   OPTIONS {ENQ,NOENQ,TEST,DEBUG,NODEBUG}   <anwhere in SYSIN> 
           {ALLDATA,EXPORT,LIST,SHOW}       <anwhere in SYSIN> 
        ENQ       issues an exclusive ENQ TEST for each data   
                  set. Dump continues if DS not available,     
                  and issues RC=4. Applies from prior DUMP on. 
        NOENQ     (default). Dumps DS as is.                   
        ALLDATA / ALLEXCP   Causes all tracks, including unused
                  ones, to be written out. May be needed to    
                  recover from invalid, non-zero LSTAR.        
                  This option also preserves LABEL=SUL data.   
        EXPORT    modifies the output DSCB1 by removing any    
                  expiration date and password flags.          
        TEST      bypasses all TAPE output. Note that file has 
                  been opened already, and will be empty.      
        DEBUG     -not implemented-                            
        NODEBUG   -not implemented-                            
        LIST / SHOW   - display current OPTION settings.       
   INCLUDE mask / DUMP mask - one or more dump requests per run
        mask      specifies a data set name (unquoted). If it  
                  contains an asterisk, question mark, or      
                  percent sign, it is treated as a mask.       
                  A name ending in a period is treated as a    
                  mask followed by an implied **               
                  In MVS (VSAM catalog), the first index level 
                  may not contain a mask character. Also note  
                  that VSAM catalog processing does not support
                  detection or processing of alias entries.    
                  Note that a percent sign is treated as a     
                  positional mask (one to one correspondence   
                  of characters/mask to dsname).               
                  Any number of DUMP cards may be used in a run
                  but only about 700 data sets will fit in the 
                  name table (assembly option)                 
   DUMP mask VOLUME(serial)   Processes matching data sets on  
                  that volume serial only. If this results in  
                  duplicate data set names, a .D#nnnnnn is     
                  appended to duplicates on higher volume      
                  serials (i.e., the cataloged entry may be the
                  one that gets renamed). Masking bytes are    
                  valid in any position in the mask.           
   EXCLUDE mask        (optional) follows relevant DUMP card   
        mask      as above. Excludes matching data sets chosen 
                  by the previous DUMP/INCLUDE/SELECT card.    
   PREFIX name    causes all data set names to be prefixed by  
                  the specified text string. It is not required
                  to be an index level (e.g., SYS9.), but if   
                  not, generated names may be syntactically    
                  invalid. Result names are truncated to 44    
                  characters, and a trailing period is blanked.
                  Only one PREFIX card may be used per run,    
                  and it is mutually exclusive of RENAME and   
                  STRIP options.                               
   STRIP name     The specified string is removed from any DSN 
                  where it is found. Multiple STRIP and RENAME 
                  requests are supported (up to 16; ASM option)
   RENAME oldname newname   The specified string is replaced in
                  any DSN found and replaced by prefix newname.
                  Up to 16 RENAME and STRIP requests are legal.
                  All strings in PREFIX/RENAME/STRIP are       
                  limited to 23 characters (assembly option).  
                                                            
  TAPE     - UNIT,DSN,VOLSER - dump tape(s) - in DSS format,    
                       uncompressed; TEST assumed if missing.  
   RECFM=U, BLKSIZE=65520 is the default for tape output.      
   RECFM=U  7892<block size<65520 is supported.                
   RECFM=V  is supported, with blocks 7900<block size<32760    
                                                            
   For DASD output, the range is 7892<data size<32760, with    
   the default being either the track size (if >=7892) or the  
   half-track size for modulo devices.
