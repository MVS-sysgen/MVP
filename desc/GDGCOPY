Description: Copies Generation Data Groups in correct order 
 GDGCOPY is a handy little utility that will copy all the generations in
 a Generation Data Group into their ascending order by creation
 (generation) number, rather than in descending order, which is what you
 will get if you allow MVS to do the concatenation for you.
 
 GDGCOPY is located in File #482 of the CBT tape and was written by Eric
 Bielefeld at P&H Mining Equipment in Milwaukee, WI.  He posted
 information about his utility on bit.listserv.ibm-main back in 2001 and
 I have kept a hardcopy of the message on the wall by my desk since
 then, thinking someday I would get around to installing this under
 Hercules/MVS.  Finally!  I'm not sure there will be a great deal of use
 for this utility in the Hercules/MVS community, but it is great to know
 that it exists and how to use it.
