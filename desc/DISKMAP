Description: MAP DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE ALLOCATION
 DISKMAP reads the VTOC for one or more DASD volumes specified and 
 produces a report that includes detailed allocation information for 
 each dataset on the selected volume(s) followed by an allocation report
 showing what tracks on the volume are allocated to each dataset.

 From the comments at the top of the source, DISKMAP originated at 
 Triangle Universities and has had extensions/modifications at several 
 installations, the last being AFDSC/SFI (Pentagon) in 1982.  There are
 a couple of versions on the CBT tape, one on the base tape at file #316
 and another on the overflow tape at file #131.  The two versions are 
 identical.
