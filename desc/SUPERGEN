Description: Like IEBGENER, but with many more options 
 SUPERGEN (SUPER IEBGENER) allows selective copying of records from
 sequential datasets with a limited facility to change the records
 during the copy operation.  It may also be used to produce hex dumps of
 data similar to the IDCAMS PRINT function.
 
 It is located in File #40 of the CBT tape and is contributed by Peoples
 National Bank of Washington.
 
 Peoples National Bank also included user documentation for all the
 utilities they submitted in CBT File 40.  I have included an Adobe PDF
 document containing the pages relevant to SUPERGEN in the installation
 archive.
