Description: TSO command prints PDS or sequential dataset to SYSOUT
 The PRINTOFF TSO command allows you to print the contents of a
 sequential dataset or partitioned dataset members.  The output from the
 command is released to JES2 immediately for processing, so you can use
 the command to produce output to an attached (to Hercules) printer
 while you remain logged onto your TSO session.
 
 There are several versions of the PRINTOFF command available, depending
 upon which version of the CBT tape you are using.  I chose the one
 located in File #325 of the current version, which includes this
 comment:
 
 PRINTOFF - The widely modified IPO supplied TSO command to print a
 (01/87)   dataset, with yet more functions added. After researching
 all versions on the CBT tape, Wells Fargo created this
 version from source from four separate files. We believe this
 contains all features currently available from all sources.
