Description: Print/punch members of partitioned datasets 
 PDSPRINT will print or punch, in alphabetical order, all or selected
 member(s) of a partitioned dataset.
 
 It is located in File #316 of the CBT tape and originated at the U.S.
 Treasury Financial Management Service.
 
 A sample of the output can be seen in [1]PDSPRINT output.  This example
 contains the output of two executions, the first uses the PRINT MEMBER
 command syntax to select a single member while the second uses the
 PRINT SCAN command syntax to select all members that have names
 matching the parameter argument.
