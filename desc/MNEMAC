Description: Extended mnemonic macros for IFOX assembler 
 Many of the more recent programs written in assembler rely upon
 extended mnemonic op codes that were not available in the MVS assembler
 - Assembler H (IFOX00).  Jan Jaeger has written a set of macros that
 provide the equivalent functionality of these newer opcodes to
 Assembler H, which will allow a number of programs to correctly
 assemble that would otherwise be unavailable for use by the Hercules'
 community.
 
 From the documentation member of file #177 of the CBT tape:
 
 ... is from Jan Jaeger, and contains an IEBUPDTE-
 unloaded library of macros, which simulate XA, ESA, OS/390,
 and z/OS (64-bit) instructions. The intent of this
 library is to be able to assemble newer code on an
 older version of the Assembler, even perhaps on
 IFOX00 ... The original version of this file came from the
 (now defunct) FILES section of the Hercules 390 Yahoo group.
