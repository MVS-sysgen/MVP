Description: Report (and copy) contents of datasets on tapes 
 TAPESCAN can be used to read a tape volume and produce a report giving
 an overview of the contents.  Although perhaps of less value running
 against virtual tapes in the Hercules environment, it also has the
 ability to copy datasets and recover data past the first end-of-volume
 indicator. Information on the report produced includes record and byte
 count, length estimate (again not very useful in our environment), and
 the display of the first 100 bytes of a specifiable number of records
 from the beginning of each data block read.
 
 TAPESCAN is located in File #102 of the CBT tape and was written by
 Will Daland at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It was
 modified by Sam Golob in 2000 to handle 64K blocks.
