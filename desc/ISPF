Description: Wally ISPF for MVS 3.8J

 This product was written for the Hercules MVS 3.8 system and attempts
 to re-create the functionality of the IBM Program Product ISPF from
 that era.  The objective is to support most of the familiar features of
 ISPF, such as menus, panels, variables, tables, messages, ISPF commands
 and PFKeys, thereby providing the look and feel of the original product.
 ISPF Version 3.2 was used as the base for development, although some
 features from subsequent versions, such as AREA support, are included.
