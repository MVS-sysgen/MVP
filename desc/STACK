Description: TSO command capture output from PUTGET I/O of next TSO command
 STACK is a TSO command processor which enables interception of PUTGET
 IO for the duration of the TSO command following STACK.  Thus the
 output from a TSO command may be directed to a dataset.  STACK imitates
 the TMP to obtain the next TSO command and attach it with the IO
 redirected via the STACK macro.  STACK can be used to execute a command
 from a specific library (for example a test version) or to call a
 program using dynamic linkage since the optional TASKDD is also used as
 the tasklib for the duration of the command.  VIO datasets may be used
 for the IO files. All operands are optional.  All file I/O must be done
 via PUTGET module to be intercepted.
 
 The source for STACK is located in File #270 of the CBT tape.  It also
 requires two additional module - KMDPARS and OPERSCAN - as well as
 several macros, all also located in File #270.  STACK was written by
 Kermit Kiser at the Washington Department of Information Services in
 Olympia, WA.
