Description: TSO command lists information about all allocated datasets
 ALIST is a TSO command that provides a better display of the same
 information that the IBM supplied LISTALC command shows, which is all
 datasets allocated to the current TSO User session.  Where LISTALC only
 shows the dataset name, ALIST includes the DD Name, dataset
 organization (DSORG), allocation type, volume serial number, and
 dataset name.
 
 ALIST is a product of Lionel Dyck at Rockwell International in Seal
 Beach, CA.  This version is from the older CBT tape, version #249.
