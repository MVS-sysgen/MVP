Description: Another IEBGENER clone, but with some useful features 
 Although SUPERGEN has more options, SYSREPRO is a good stand-in for
 IEBGENER when you need to quickly copy all or part of a sequential
 dataset.  As a bonus, you get a summary report of what was copied.
 
 It is located in File #316 of the CBT tape and is part of the large
 suite of batch utility programs contributed by Jim Marshall of the U.S.
 Treasury.  The program was originally written by Bill Godfrey at the
 Planning Research Corporation.
