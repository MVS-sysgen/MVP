Description: Interface to TSO CALL, use in Clists, etc.
 THE $ COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND        
 FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE 'SYS1.LINKLIB' DATA SETS;        
 THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES AS WELL AS          
 SPNB PROGRAMS SUCH AS MRCLEAN AND LISTPDS#.                   
                                                               
 ADVANTAGES OF THE $ COMMAND OVER CALL:                        
 1) THE $ COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR              
    ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;         
 2) THE $ COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES LESS TYPING;  
 3) THE $ COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF THE LINKLIB 
    DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE DATA SETS THE      
    PROGRAM IS IN.
