Description: VSAM Catalog List Utility 
 VSAMLIST scans one or more specified VSAM Catalogs and produces a
 summary report of the catalog contents, a detail report of the VSAM
 volume contents, and a VSAM track allocation map.  It can also be used
 to maintain a history file for all VSAM entries reported by the
 program.  The most useful feature that it provides is the means to
 review allocation and utilization information for VSAM objects, similar
 to a VTOC listing for Non-VSAM datasets.
 
 It is located in File #38 of the CBT Overflow tape and originally came
 from Memorex.  The version I have used for installation came from
 Version #466 of the CBT collection.
 
 Prerequisite:  The MVT Sort/Merge must be installed on your system for
 this program to execute.
