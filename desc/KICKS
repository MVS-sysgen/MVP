Description: KICKS for TSO

 KICKS is an enhancement for CMS & TSO on IBM mainframes (or emulators)
 that lets you run your CICS applications directly instead of having to
 'install' those apps in CICS. You don't even need CICS itself installed
 on your mainframe.

 KICKS provides a high level of source code compatibility with CICS. You can
 migrate applications either way between CICS and KICKS simply by recompiling.
 Whether for ease of testing, fast deployment to small groups of users, or
 simple Guerrilla Marketing, join your colleagues using KICKS to speed up
 their development efforts.
