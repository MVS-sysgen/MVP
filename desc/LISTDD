Description: TSO command to list attributes of allocated datasets 
 The LISTDD TSO command displays dataset information for a specified
 allocated DD name or for all allocated DD names.  The format is similar
 to LISTA output, but allows selection of single DD name and displays
 all information at one time.
 
 The source for LISTDD was the XEPHON MVS Update (1988) from the CBT
 tape (file #830); the original author was Paul Horak.
