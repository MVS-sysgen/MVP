Description: TSO command to display information about a member of PDS. 
 MEMBER is a TSO command that displays the information returned by the
 BLDL macro for the specified member of a Partitioned Dataset.  For load
 modules, it formats the information contained in the user data field.
 For members created by ISPF or RPF, it formats the statistics.  For
 load modules, it can list ESD and IDR information.
 
 I retrieved it from File #300 of the #437 version of the CBT tape and
 is part of a collection of TSO commands from Jim Marshall of the Air
 Force.  It was originally written by Bill Godfrey at the Planning
 Research Corporation in January of 1977.
