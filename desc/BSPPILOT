Description: BSPPILOT - The MVS Auto Pilot 

 The idea to the MVS auto pilot was taken from CBT tape 249, file 33.
 Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to assemble correctly fro MVS 3.8.

 After a little bit of poking around in the source and doing a few
 changes here and there I could get it to compile, but it didn't
 work reliably.  That's when I decided to rewrite the whole thing
 and, while being at it, add a few functions as well

 Rewrite might be too strong a word, though.  Large portions of the
 R2D2 part in IEECVXIT were taken unchanged from the CBT tape

 SAMPLE EXECUTION JCL can be found in SYS2.SAMPLIB(BSPPILOT)

 Add the following to SYS1.PARLIB(COMMND00) to start BSPPILOT on IPL:
 COM='S BSPPILOT'

 What do we have now:
    * IEECVXIT - The WTO exit to automatically react to WTOs.  This
                 function is table driven, and currently the following
                 messages are recognized (and are being processed on)
                   IST020I        S TSO          s TSO
                   IEE362A        S DUMPSMF      dump full SYS1.MANx

                   BSPSD999       S BSPSHUTD     Initiate shutdown
                 The routing and descriptor codes of the following
                 messages are altered such that they are now
                 roll-deletetable
                    IEA911E        full dump on XXXX for asid N
                    IEA994E        partial dump.....
                    IEA994A        all dump datasets are full

                    IGF991E        IGF msg for mount, swap etc
                 The following messages are suppressed altogether
                    BSPTEST1       used for playtesting Autopilot
                    $HASP000       JEs OK msg
    * R2D2     - An SRB routine that runs in the BSPPILOT address
                 space and replies to the following WTORs

    * BSPPILOT - (Or should this be called C3PO)? A address space which
                 is doing nothing most of the time. It serves as the
                 companion address space to R2D2 and IEECVXIT.  The
                 WTO exit and the WTOR reply processor will only if and
                 only if the BSPPILOT address space is running.  You
                 might consider starting it via COMMND00 processing of
                 SYS1.PARMLIB
 
                 The operator (that is you) can communicate with
                 BSPPILOT via modify commands.  Some of them are useful
                 some not quite so useful
                   P BSPPILOT            These commands will gracefully
                   F BSPPILOT,STOP       terminate the MVS autopilot
                   F BSPPILOT,END        and disable WTO(R) processing
 
                   F BSPPILOT,SHUTDOWN   will initiate the MVS shutdown
                                         processing.  A script in
                                         SYS1.PARMLIB(SHUTDOWN) will
                                         be used to run operator
                                         commands shutdown sequence
 
                   F BSPPILOT,SHUTFAST   Same as above, except that the
                                         operator will not be asked for
                                         confirmation of the shutdown
                                         request first
                                         commands shutdown sequence
 
                   F BSPPILOT,SHUTCANC   Will cancel the shutdown
                                         sequence that was initiated via
                                         the SHUTDOWN or SHUTFAST modify
                                         command
                                         commands shutdown sequence
 
                   F BSPPILOT,CAT        Shows the splash screen
 
                   F BSPPILOT,COOKIE     Gives you a wisdom from the
                                         fortune cookie jar
 
                   F BSPPILOT,SETPF      Invokes BSPSETPF program to
                                         set MVS console function keys
 
                   F BSPPILOT,LISTAPF    Invokes BSPAPFLS to list the
                   F BSPPILOT,APFLIST    APF priviledged data sets
 
                   F BSPPILOT,TEST       Issues a WTOR and a WTO that
                                         can be used in play testing
                                         the autooperator
                   F BSPPILOT,SCRIPT=sss This runs the script sss from
                   F BSPPILOT,RUN=sss    the PDS that is in the SCRIPTS
                                         DDNAME of the BSPPILOT proc.
                                         If there is no SCRIPTS DD name
                                         SYS1.PARMLIB will be used
