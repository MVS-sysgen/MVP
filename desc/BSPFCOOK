Description: Fortune Cookie Jar'

 This program display my snoozing little cat (well, actually, he   
 is no longer little at all, but a proud, big tomcat.  But snoozing
 is still his favourite pastime)                                   
                                                                   
 As usual, my little cat comes with some wisdom from the fortune   
 cookie jar.  I merged my database with about 7000 entries with    
 the one found on CBTTAPE 429, file 300, member MURPHY

 The program detects the environment it is running in and uses
 WTO when running as STC, PUT when running as batch, and TPUT
 when running under TSO

 If not controlled, work will flow to the competent man ....
