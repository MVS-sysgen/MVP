Description: List and/or punch source libraries or datasets 
 LISTPDS is a dataset utility program for listing and/or punching source
 libraries or datasets.  It generates formatted listings of a PDS's
 directory, the contents of processed members or sequential files, as
 well as (optionally) punching processed members and/or sequential
 datasets.  Records may be generated which allow the output to be used
 in conjunction with the IBM utility IEBUPDTE.
 
 LISTPDS is located in File #316 of the CBT tape and was developed by
 Gene Czarcinski at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.
