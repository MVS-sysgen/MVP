Description: Unload Partitioned Dataset contents to sequential dataset (see PDSLOAD) 
 OFFLOAD will process a Partitioned Dataset as input and extract the
 contents of the members to a sequential output dataset.  Members may be
 selected for processing by the use of SELECT control cards or excluded
 from selection by the use of EXCLUDE control cards.  The contents of
 members selected for processing may have IEBUPDTE ./ ADD control cards
 written preceding them on the output dataset by the use of a control
 card option.
 
 This utility was written by David Cole of Cole Software (known more
 recently for his XDC product).  I extracted this version from Jim
 Marshall's collection of utilities in file #316 of the older version
 249 CBT tape.
