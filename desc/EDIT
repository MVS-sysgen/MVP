Description: TSTVS Console Editor and Dataset Utility
 TSTVS is a utility program which is run from the
 Operator Console.  Commands are entered from the
 console, and replies are sent back to the console.

 TSTVS is a line editor which can be used to fix
 FB-80 datasets like PARMLIB datasets or started
 PROCs in SYS1.PROCLIB, before JES2 has come up, 
 or it can be executed afterwards.

 You can execute S EDIT after JES2 is up.

 Or:  S EDIT,SUB=MSTR   before JES2 is up.

 TSTVS is an excellent recovery tool, for when an
 MVS system (or OS/390, z/OS etc.) is only partially
 up, and a dataset or member needs to be fixed.
