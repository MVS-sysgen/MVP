Description: Allows global modifications of contents of libraries 
 PDSUPDTE is a reconstituted version of the IPOUPDTE program (also

 search/replace type modifications to JCL or control cards contained in
 all members of one to several libraries (Partitioned Datasets).  It can
 also be useful for searching for and changing fields in source code
 statements.
 
 PDSUPDTE is located in File #65 of the CBT Overflow tape and is part of
 a collection submitted by the Los Angeles User Group.
